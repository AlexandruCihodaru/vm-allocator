# Vm-allocator

Main components are:
Constraints: describe resource allocation constraints.
IntervalTree: An VMM specified interval tree responsible for allocating and releasing resources.

```rust
pub struct Constraint {
    /// Size to allocate.
    pub size: u64,
    /// Lower boundary for the allocated resource.
    pub min: u64,
    /// Upper boundary for the allocated resource.
    pub max: u64,
    /// Alignment for the allocated resource.
    pub align: u64,
    /// Resource allocation policy.
    pub policy: AllocPolicy,
}
```

Struct Constraint is used to describe the overall information of the resource needed to be allocated and IntervalTree could use the Constraint information to know where and how to allocate the resource.
